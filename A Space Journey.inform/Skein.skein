    <result xml:space="preserve">Johnson's Hall&#x000A;Hey! This is the same house as the one you saw on the doctors desk! Maybe he will be able to explain why you haven't seen a single person yet. You try to open the door and find it unlocked. You cautiously enter the building and call out a hesitant, " H-hello?" but you get no reply. The house is a single story with four different rooms. There is a kitchen/eating area to the north, two bedrooms to the east, a study to the west, and the exist is to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see Bedroom door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
