You were chosen from random lottery to be sent to join the experimental colony on Xuria because Earth is falling apart due to climate change and dwindling resources. It is time to start your new life on this great new planet. However you should probably put on your gear first. There might be fire or sharp fragments of the ship outside after that rough landing.&#x000A;&#x000A;Welcome&#x000A;A Space Journey&#x000A;Release 1 / Serial number 150416 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD&#x000A;&#x000A;Mid Deck&#x000A;The interior of the rocketship is almost entirely white.
