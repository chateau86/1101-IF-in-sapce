    <result xml:space="preserve">You open the bedroom door and immediately regret your decision. On the bed in the middle of the room is who you assume to be the doctor and his family huddled together. They are all very clearly dead and have been for a while judging by the smell that just hit your nose. You back out of the room and slam the door shut. You wonder what the heck has happened to all of the people on Xuria.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

You try to open the door and find it unlocked. You cautiously enter the building and call out a hesitant, " H-hello?" but you get no reply. The house is a single story with four different rooms. There is a kitchen/eating area to the north, two bedrooms to the east, a study to the west, and the exit is to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see Bedroom door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
