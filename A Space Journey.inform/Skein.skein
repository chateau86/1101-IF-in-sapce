The planet is located in a different galaxy and accessible only through a wormhole. The planet, Xuria, has been found to be teeming with exotic plant life, quite habitable compared to Earth.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;You can't believe you've finally made it. It seems like forever since you boarded the small rocket. Your journey from Earth to the planet Xuria has taken almost a year, even though you were traveling as close to light speed as is possible. You were chosen from random lottery to be sent to join the experimental colony on Xuria because Earth is falling apart due to climate change and dwindling resources. It is time to start your new life on this great new planet. However you should probably put on your gear first. There might be fire or sharp fragments of the ship outside after that rough landing.&#x000A;&#x000A;Welcome&#x000A;A Space Journey by Allen Chan, Kelsey Tweed, Tarun Nadimpalli, Woradorn Kamolpornwijit&#x000A;Release 1 / Serial number 150417 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD&#x000A;&#x000A;Mid Deck&#x000A;The interior of the rocketship is almost entirely white.

You can hear some distorted sounds that you think are an occasional sigh or mumble of frustration. You focus on the papers the person is examining and see that they are patient files like the ones you were looking at earlier.
