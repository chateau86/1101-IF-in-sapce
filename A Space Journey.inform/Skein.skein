    <result xml:space="preserve">parking lot&#x000A;You look around you and see a surprising amount of vegetation. Its amazing how similar Xuria's atmosphere is to Earth's. You are in a parking lot for space ships. The lot is empty except for an old spaceplane. The crash site is where the radio antenna array was. A shame that its now burnt to a crisp after the crash. To the North you can see some buildings that almost certainly make up the colony.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see Ship door and Spaceplane (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

You just can't kill that that thing, not even with years of neglect. They just don't build "em like they used to. This one seems to be in a relatively good condition, compared to the ones on your last job, at least.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
