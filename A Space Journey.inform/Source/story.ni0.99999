Chapter 0 - Meta declaration

[From 'Meaningful instruction']
Underlying relates various things to one thing. The verb to underlie means the underlying relation. The verb to be under means the underlying relation. The verb to be beneath means the underlying relation.
	Instead of looking under a thing which is underlaid by something (called the lost object):
	Say "You've discovered [the list of things which underlie the noun]!";
		now every thing which underlies the noun is carried by the player;
		now every thing which underlies the noun does not underlie the noun.

understand "install [something] onto [vehicle]" as inserting it into.

Chapter 1 - Story


When play begins:
say "[italic type]It is the year 2315, you are an astronaut who embarks on a journey a new planet, due to overpopulation and climate change destroying valuable resources on Earth. The planet is located in a different galaxy and accessible only through a wormhole. The planet, Xuria, has been found to be teeming with exotic plant life, quite habitable compared to Earth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




[bold type]You can’t believe you’ve finally made it. It seems like forever since you boarded the small rocket. Your journey from Earth to the planet Xuria has taken almost a year, even though you were traveling as close to light speed as is possible. You were chosen from random lottery to be sent to join the experimental colony on Xuria because Earth is falling apart due to climate change and dwindling resources. It is time to start your new life on this great new planet. However you should probably put on your gear first. There might be fire or sharp fragments of the ship outside after that rough landing.”


The Mid Deck is a room. "The interior of the rocketship is almost entirely white. Your room is on the east side. On the west side of the room is a small cubicle that leads to the bathroom.
